## North Star Cafe Waitlist App
https://a3-chrislam.onrender.com 

I have always been into making drinks especially in a home cafe setting. This project acts as a waitlist signup for prospective customers where they can see the potential menu in the future. On the top right, the person filling out the form can see their entries, while additionally editing their information. For anyone else they want to fill it out for will be there.

The login info will just be basic for now (OAuth too much for me at the current moment). The one with cookies and basic authentication (username & password) is what we did. Below is the info for you to login to. However, if you do not have an account, you can create a new one automatically! After the toast, log in with your new one.

Username: admin

Password: admin

The CSS framework that I used was TailwindCSS. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework, making it easier to add in-line CSS, great for a power user like me (I have coded with this many times). Through Tailwind, in essence I removed the CSS file worked with in A2 and put it in-line in the relevant HTML files.

I did not use any other frameworks, however, I did have to grab icon images from lucide-react for the tables (Pencil for edit and Trash for delete). There were no other middleware packages used from express other than the ones used from the guide.

Some challenges I faced was definitely the login functionality with cookies. I have never done that on my own, and it was a lot more diificult to get everything wrapped around the middleware for the first time. However, I did it!

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Deployed on Render instead of Glitch

I hosted this app on Render instead of Glitch. This was my first time using it, and it was a great experience. I just had to connect to GitHub, get the repo, then put in my API_KEY, BOOM DEPLOY. The reason I chose this over glitch is because I just found out Glitch is super old, and it does not support the newer versions of Node, MongoDB, and Express. I know in the assignment there were steps but it was impossible bc the errors were in the node modules and it was not worth destroying my project over. Render handles everything better than Glitch, AND is more modern for this type of work, where it neeeds and Express backend.
