## North Star Cafe Waitlist App
https://a3-chrislam.vercel.app

I have always been into making drinks especially in a home cafe setting. This project acts as a waitlist signup for prospective customers where they can see the potential menu in the future. On the top right, the person filling out the form can see their entries, while additionally editing their information. For anyone else they want to fill it out for will be there.

The login info will just be basic for now (OAuth too much for me at the current moment). The one with cookies and basic authentication (username & password) is what we did. Below is the info for you to login to. However, if you do not have an account, you can create a new one automatically! After the toast, log in with your new one.

Username: admin

Password: admin

The CSS framework that I used was TailwindCSS. TailwindCSS is a utility CSS framework, making it easier to add in-line CSS, great for a power user like me (I have coded with this many times). Through Tailwind, in essence I removed the CSS file worked with in A2 and put it in-line in the relevant HTML files.

I did not use any other frameworks, however, I did have to grab icon images from lucide-react for the tables (Pencil for edit and Trash for delete). There were no other middleware packages used from express other than the ones used from the guide.

Some challenges I faced was definitely the login functionality with cookies. I have never done that on my own, and it was a lot more diificult to get everything wrapped around the middleware for the first time. However, I did it!

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Deployed on Vercel instead of Glitch

I hosted my website on Vercel instead of Glitch. I have used Vercel multiple times for my Next.js projects, as it is so easy to use as a power/intermediate user. This is because you can connect your GitHub to it, you select your project, and boom host after putting in any other data such as .env. It is better because it actually stays awake AND if you ever push to main, Vercel will see that and update the changes on the actual deployment website!
